	@brief Support for I/O streams.

	The stream model of tinyos3 is similar to the Unix model.
	Streams are objects that are shared between processes.
	Streams are accessed by file IDs (similar to file descriptors
	in Unix).

	The streams of each process are held in the file table of the
	PCB of the process. The system calls generally use the API
	of this file to access FCBs: @ref get_fcb, @ref FCB_reserve
	and @ref FCB_unreserve.

	Streams are connected to devices by virtue of a @c file_operations
	object, which provides pointers to device-specific implementations
	for read, write and close.
